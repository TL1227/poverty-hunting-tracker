# Poverty Hunting Tracker
Track your fortune!

## Poverty Hunting Rules
- You must pick a free hunter
- You must NOT buy any extra equipment (Not even medkits!)
- Take any money you make in a match and half it
- Half goes to your "Vault" to be kept save for a rainy day
- The other half goes into your "Wallet" where you can spend it freely  

**Good luck out there!**
